This is the Ninjaz Task, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start the Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run the App. :partying_face:

## Step 3: App Structure

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's check the structure. It's made with the atomic design concepts.

1. Components (Atoms, Molecules and Organisms)
2. Screens
3. Api
4. Redux
5. Theme
6. Models
7. Navigation

## Step 4: Tools/Packages

1. React Navigation: handles bottom tab bar navigation
2. Redux: A global state management
3. React Native Toast Message: displays an easy-to-read success or error message
4. Async Storage: persists data in case of offline connection
5. Moment: Date format and manipulation
6. React Native size matters: A lightweight, React-Native utility belt for scaling the size of the app UI across different dimensions
7. React Native fast image: handles image caching
8. RTK Query: handles api calls
